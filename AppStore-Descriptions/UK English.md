View a lifetime of photos - Leit

## 2. Description
Combine and organise all your photos in a single view with Leit!

People have more than 10,000 photos... How many of them do you view? These days, all of us suffer from a serious problem called “photo fragmentation.” Symptoms include repeatedly hearing a voice in your head saying: “Where the hell was that photo?!” We simply don’t have an easy way to remember, view, or organise all the photos we’ve taken and saved in various storage, cloud services, and social networks.

We have a cure.

This is how it works: Just let us know which services or devices have your photos. Leit will auto-magically analyse metadata from your favourite devices and services (like your Mac, Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox, and Instagram) and organise them by timeline and location into a single beautiful and easy to use Leit interface! Leit updates automatically whenever new photos are added or if you are “tagged” in Facebook.

▶ View all your photos in a beautiful Timeline. We auto-magically pull photos from your various storage services and organise them in a single awesome and elegant timeline.

▶ View all your photos with Motifs. We auto-magically analyse existing metadata to group your photos with simple-to-use and intuitive tags.

▶ Someone tag you in a photo? No worries. We pull those photos into your timeline too.

WE SAY BYE-BYE TO 'PHOTO FRAGMENTATION'! KEEP YOUR PHOTOS ORGANISED AND VIEW THEM ALL AT ONCE IN A BEAUTIFUL TIMELINE on LEIT!

Simply connect to your Mac, PC, Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox and Instagram. We pull your photos (tagged ones too) into Leit!
