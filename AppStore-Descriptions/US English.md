## 1. Name
View all your scattered photos - Leit

## 2. Description
View and organize all your photos in one place with Leit!

People have more than 10,000 photos... How many of them do you view? These days, all of us suffer from a serious problem called “photo fragmentation.” We simply don’t have an easy way to view and organize all the photos we’ve taken and saved in various storage, cloud services, and social networks.

Leit is a cure.

This is how it works: Just let us know which services or devices have your photos. Leit will auto-magically analyze metadata from your favorite devices and services (like your Mac, Facebook, Flickr, Dropbox, and Instagram) and organize them by timeline and location into a single beautiful and easy to use Leit interface!

▶ View all your photos in a beautiful Timeline. We auto-magically pull photos from your various storage services and organize them in a single awesome and elegant timeline.

▶ View all your photos with Motifs. We auto-magically analyze existing metadata to group your photos with simple-to-use and intuitive tags.

WE SAY BYE-BYE TO 'PHOTO FRAGMENTATION'!  KEEP YOUR PHOTOS ORGANIZED AND VIEW THEM ALL AT ONCE IN A BEAUTIFUL TIMELINE on LEIT! 

Simply connect to your Mac, PC, Facebook, Flickr,  Dropbox and Instagram. We pull your photos (tagged ones too) into Leit!
